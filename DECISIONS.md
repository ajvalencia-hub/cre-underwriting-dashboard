# Decisions Log

Non-obvious choices made during the autonomous build run, with the
alternatives rejected. Financial-convention decisions are marked **[FIN]**.

## F1 — Deal persistence

- **Deleting a deal cascades its scenarios.** Alternative rejected: orphaning
  them (deal_id = NULL) would silently re-attach them to the Default Deal on
  the next backfill run, resurrecting deleted work under the wrong deal.
  Cascade matches the existing template-deletion behavior.
- **URL quick-screen params override the stored deal only on first page load,
  then autosave syncs them into the deal.** Alternative rejected: applying the
  URL on every deal switch would clobber every deal a user flips through with
  the same shared-link values.
- **Deal.inputs is one JSON blob (form values + a `quickScreen` key) rather
  than normalized columns.** The input schema is data-driven and changes
  shape by property type; a blob keeps the autosave a single PUT and needs no
  migration per schema change. No schema field id can collide with the
  `quickScreen` key today; the hydration helper strips it defensively.
